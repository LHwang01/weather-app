<p>
Welcome! This is a weather application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Fetch and event listeners were used to create the functionalities and the OpenWeatherMap API, which you can find [here](https://openweathermap.org/api). From the OpenWeatherMap API response, the application displays the user's current location name, temperature in either farenheit or celsius, a description of the weather, and an image to compliment everything. The code has passed the HTML and CSS validators, with the CSS badge being displayed on the page.
